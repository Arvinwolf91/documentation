## Overview

Datadog [Infrastructure Vulnerability Management][1] leverages infrastructure observability to detect, prioritize, manage and remediate vulnerabilities in your organization. It allows you to track the vulnerabilities to closure with the understanding of your infrastructure, and its ownership, across your organization. The private beta offers visibility into the vulnerabilities in the [Container Images][2] on your host.

## Review the health of your container images

Infrastructure Vulnerability Management offers vulnerabilities in the Container Images on your hosts.
- View your container images on the [Container Images][2] page. 
- Sort images by the number of active containers (column name `CONTAINERS`).
- Observe the number of vulnerabilities that exist in the container image (column name `VULNERABILITIES`).
View additional details about any vulnerability by clicking on the container image and reviewing the "Vulnerabilities" tab.

## Identify the top container-based vulnerabilities

View a consolidated list of all vulnerabilities on the [Vulnerabilities][3] page in [Cloud Security Management][4].
Prioritize them for remediation based on severity.
View additional information about each vulnerability by clicking on the vulnerability. This information includes information about affected container images, the date on which the vulnerability was last detected, a description of the vulnerability, and recommended remediation steps.
