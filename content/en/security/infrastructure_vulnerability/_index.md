Datadog [Infrastructure Vulnerability Management][1] uses the Datadog Agent to monitor your container images and identify known vulnerabilities for you to prioritize and remediate. The Agent scans running container images on hosts and creates a software bill of materials (SBOM). The SBOM is then scanned for vulnerabilities.

## Review the health of your container images

View a list of running container images on the [Container Images][2] page. Identify container images with vulnerabilities and view additional details about the vulnerability on the details page.

## Identify the top container-based vulnerabilities

Prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation based on severity on the [Vulnerabilities][3] page. View additional information about each vulnerability on the details page, including number of impacted images, the date on which the vulnerability was last detected, a description of the vulnerability, and recommended remediation steps.
